# Data Science Job Success Prediction
# ABSTRACT

In the rapidly growing field of data science, predicting job success can provide valuable insights for students, educators, and recruiters. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the job success probability of data science students based on various academic, professional, and skill-based attributes. The dataset undergoes extensive preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying feature scaling. A train-test split is performed to ensure effective model evaluation. Three classification models Logistic Regression, Random sForest, and XGBoost are implemented to analyze key factors influencing job success. Random Forest, an ensemble method using bagging, enhances generalization, while XGBoost, a boosting-based approach, improves predictive accuracy by focusing on misclassified instances. The models are evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness in predicting job success. The results highlight the significance of factors such as educational background, relevant experience, technical skills, and industry exposure in determining job success. The study also emphasizes the advantages of ensemble learning techniques in improving prediction reliability. The findings offer actionable insights for students to enhance their employability and for institutions to design better career guidance programs. This project showcases the power of machine learning in career outcome prediction and demonstrates its potential to support data science students in their professional journeys.
